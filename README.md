# ShinyApp
Shiny App for the Coursera Data Product course

This application uses the Galton methodology to predict the children height based on parents' height.

In order for this app to run correctly, please make sure you have the latest release of R installed.
For windows environments it will also require Rtools.
Also the "shiny" package has to be instaled.

The data input is on the left panel. The data input's are the father's height and the mother's height in inches.
The right hand-side panel displays the inputs as well as the predicted child's height together with the min and max interval.
