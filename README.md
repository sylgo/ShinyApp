# ShinyApp
##Shiny App for the Coursera Data Product course

This application uses the Galton methodology to predict the children height based on parents' height.

The app requires the latest release of R installed.
For windows environments it will also require Rtools.
Also the "shiny" package has to be instaled.

The data input is on the left panel. The data input's are the father's height and the mother's height in inches.
The right hand-side panel displays the inputs as well as the predicted child's height together with the min and max interval.

The app was part of the course submission and a link to the curent version can be found at https://silvone.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp
